Implement a C program that takes two filename as command-line arguments and concatenates the contents of the second file to the first file.

# Description
The theme of this project is to write a C program with variable number of keywords as Command Line Arguments, it reads two files till the end and concatinates in the information of second file to the first file.

# Getting 
Started These steps will give you an idea of the project. Moreover, we do run our program in our local system for testing and developing.

# Prerequisites 
Requirements for the software to run, execute, and develop are: gcc - GNU Compiler Collection Text-editor

# Installing 
here we discuss how installation process work

Open the text editor
create a c programing file
save the file with .c extension
# Running
the tests In this program we consider taking three command line arguments, file name as well as two files fileone and filetwo as input. Later, we read the first file and append the second file to the first file using O_APPEND function.  

To understand the execution part in a better way how a program is executed. First, use 'gcc filename.c' to compile. Then, run using './a.out'.

To run the program, we should do these steps: 1.gcc example.c 2. ./a.out an the or a an an the the or

# output: 
fileone :hivarun 
filetwo:varun
